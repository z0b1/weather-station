# weather-station
I'm presenting my project of a Field Weather Station containing anemometers and wind direction sensors, also ambient temp. and humidity sensors with a homemade UHF transmitter in the field and an at home reciever(also homemade). This also includes an RPi3 B+ that is recieving satellite images and displaying them in a mobile phone app.
